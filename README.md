From an early age, I've developed a passion for computer science, with a particular interest in backend development, exploring its various aspects before my formal studies at Hansung University. 

My focus has now shifted towards the exciting field of machine learning, with a special interest in GANs, Computer Vision, and Optimization. These areas are where I'm putting my research efforts and enthusiasm, as I prepare for the next stage of my academic journey.


### Interest
- Aritificial Intelligence (GAN, Super Resolution, Optimization, Computer Vision)
- Backend Development
